# craps

ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
In this assignment you’ll be creating a main program called Craps.java, which will allow the user to play
the game of craps on the computer. The program will make use of at least one helper class, Die.java.

BACKGROUND
The basic rules for playing craps are relatively simple:
1. A player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the numbers rolled together.
2. On this first roll, a 7 or an 11 automatically wins, and a 2, 3, or 12 automatically loses, and play is
over. If a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 are rolled on this first roll, that number becomes the "point.”
3. The player continues to roll the two dice again until one of two things happens: either they roll the
"point" from that first roll again, in which case they win; or they roll a 7, in which case they lose.
Playing craps can include a number of variations on this game, and also typically involves betting on
various outcomes; those aspects of the game are not covered in this assignment.

PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
Create a Java program, with associated classes, that:
a. asks the user if they’d like to play craps
b. asks the user if they need instructions, and provide them if desired
c. requires the user to press the <Enter> key each time they want to roll the dice
d. provides status information on the user’s roll, the point, and whether the user has won or lost
e. asks the user if they’d like to play again
f. includes JavaDoc comments, supplemented with additional comments before submitting.
